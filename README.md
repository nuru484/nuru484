## About Me

I am a curious, self-taught developer specializing in full-stack development with the PERN stack. I built my foundation through The Odin Project's comprehensive, project-based curriculum, which taught me both practical skills and best practices in web development.

Beyond the core PERN stack, I've expanded my toolkit to include:

- Performance: Redis for caching
- Database: Prisma ORM
- Real-time Features: Socket.io
- Security: JWT authentication

Some notable projects I've built include:

- Full-stack Blog Platform: Features real-time commenting and liking, rich text editing and admin dashboard for managing posts.
- QR Code Event Management System: Handles event registration and attendance tracking using QR codes
- School Management System: Comprehensive solution for managing students, courses, and grades

Currently, I'm deepening my expertise in:

- Systems Design: Microservices architecture, API design patterns
- Performance: Caching strategies, load balancing, application optimization
- Database Management: Scaling strategies, query optimization
- Security: Authentication flows, secure coding practices
- Computer Science Fundamentals: Data structures, algorithms, Java programming

While seeking a position where I can collaborate with senior engineers to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios and continue growing as a developer.
