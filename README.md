## Fullstack Engineer | Systems Programming Enthusiast | Building for Impact
Hi, I'm Nurudeen from Ghana. I build production-grade web applications, but I'm really here because I'm obsessed with understanding how computers work at the lowest levels.

**Background:** Self-taught developer who went from graphic design to full-stack engineering through pure curiosity and necessity. No CS degree, just relentless learning and building.

Check out my pinned repos for my most recent works.

Currently seeking remote opportunities where I can contribute while continuing to grow toward building technology that creates lasting impact.
