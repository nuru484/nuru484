## Fullstack Engineer • Systems Programming Enthusiast • Building for Impact

Hi, I'm **Nurudeen** from Ghana. I build production-grade web applications, but I'm really here because I'm obsessed with understanding how computers work at the lowest levels.

**Background:**
Self-taught developer who transitioned from graphic design to full-stack engineering through pure curiosity and necessity. No CS degree—just relentless learning and building.

👉 Check out my pinned repos for my latest projects.

**Currently:**
Seeking remote opportunities where I can contribute while growing toward building technology that creates lasting impact.
